# NewYorkAirBnB
This Statistical Analyses of Registered AirBnB Properties in New York City using Artificial Intelligence Models has been part of my Artificial Intelligence course.

I used two types of regression models: 'Mean of Linear Regressor' and 'Mean of Decision Tree Regressor'.

I experimented with the LabelEncoder class from sklearn library to fix the categorical data for the columns: “Neighbourhood_group”: (Manhatan, Queens, Bronx...) and “room_type”: (shared room, private room, apartment). Following by using dummy variables to encode the data into the columns.

For the Linear Regression and the Decision Three I tried several ways of approach. I experimented with the set of input columns, I added and dropped columns which in my opinion had no great effect on the result.

I tested different ways of working with the data like lists and Datasets, numerous regression techniques like linear regression, decision three which is a method that can be used for both classification and regression. I found the information very interesting and I understood that I want to continue my realization in the world of Artificial Intelligence. This course helped me a lot since it is made in very practical way using recent techniques, used in the real-world as contrary to all courses online which show old-fashioned tactics of handling the data.
